FightAI Portable
=================

1) Ensure the embedded Python runtime exists at:
   FightAI\runtime\python\python.exe

2) Launch the app by double-clicking FightAI.cmd
   in the top-level folder (next to the main README).

If you supply a FightAI.exe launcher, it can be used instead of FightAI.cmd.
