FightAI Portable
=================

1) Launch the app by double-clicking FightAI.vbs (or FightAI-debug.cmd).

2) On first launch, the embedded Python runtime is downloaded automatically to:
   FightAI\runtime\python\python.exe

3) Each launch writes a log to your Desktop named:
   GrapplingPipelineCodexLog.txt

If you supply a FightAI.exe launcher, it can be used instead of FightAI.cmd.
