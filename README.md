FightAI Portable (Windows)
==========================

One-click launch: double-click `FightAI.cmd` in the top-level folder.

Download the repository ZIP from GitHub, unzip it, then double-click
`FightAI.cmd` (it sits beside this README).

The portable layout expects an embedded Python runtime at:
`FightAI/runtime/python/python.exe`.
If that runtime is not present, the launcher will fail.
