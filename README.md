FightAI Portable (Windows)
==========================

Download the repository ZIP from GitHub, unzip it, then open the `FightAI` folder
and double-click `FightAI.exe` (preferred) or `FightAI.cmd`.

Offline runtime requirements are bundled in `FightAI/runtime/python`. If you see
an error about the Python runtime missing, the embedded runtime has not been
placed in that folder.
