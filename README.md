FightAI Portable (Windows)
==========================

Download the repository ZIP from GitHub, unzip it, then open the `FightAI` folder
and double-click `FightAI.cmd`.

The portable layout expects an embedded Python runtime at:
`FightAI/runtime/python/python.exe`.
If that runtime is not present, the launcher will fail.
